# NLG School Timatable Bot

## This bot is for personal use, directly made for Németh László Gimnázium's 11/a grades timetable.

The concept of the bot is appliable for different schools and timetables as well, since it reads it from JSON files.

If you - for some reason - want to use this bot for your schools online education, you only need to replace files in the `source/timetable/` and `source/students/` folders.
